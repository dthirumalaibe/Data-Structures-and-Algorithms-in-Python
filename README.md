# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python
Jupyter notebook(in `notebooks`) and source code(in `source_code`)for exercises(Reinforcement and Creativity).


For convenience purposes, we give the link of the notebooks in nbviewer:

[Chap1 Python Primer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shenxiangzhuang/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Chap1%20Python%20Primer.ipynb)

[Chap2 Object-Oriented Programming](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shenxiangzhuang/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Chap2%20Object-Oriented%20Programming.ipynb)

[Chap3 Algorithm Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shenxiangzhuang/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Chap3%20Algorithm%20Analysis.ipynb)


[Chap4 Recursion](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shenxiangzhuang/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Chap4%20Recursion.ipynb)

[Chap5 Array-Based Sequences](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shenxiangzhuang/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Chap5%20Array-Based%20Sequences.ipynb)

Since Chap6, we build a local package `pyds` for convenience, which contains the
data structures used in the textbook. 

You can clone the repository to your PC then run `pip install -e pkg` in the folder to install the package `pyds` in development mode. Read pip' doc for more information. After that, we can use `import pyds` freely.


[Chap6 Stacks&Queues&Deques](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shenxiangzhuang/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Chap6%20Stacks%26Queues%26Deques.ipynb)
